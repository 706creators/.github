## ü•≥ Hi, this is Creators Community!

We're focused on building creative things and tech products through a diverse range of co-learning topics, including:

- **‚õì Blockchain**: covering Ethereum, Solana, Sui, and other blockchain protocols;
- **üóù Zero-knowledge proofs**: including foundamental theories of zk circuit, implementing Plonk using python, delving into advanced zk protocols like Halo2;
- **üíª Development**: encompassing low-code tools, the prevailing trend empowering individuals of all backgrounds to create their own products;
- **üéÆ Game programming**: exploring Unity and fully on-chain game development on Dojo framework;
- **üé® Design**: UI/UX design with Figma and design thinking methodologies such as service design systems;
- **üí¨ Language acquistion**: focusing on English language learning for web3 parctitioners;
- **ü™§ Tokenomics**
- ...... and more!!!!


We have over 130,000 subscribers on wechat which is the biggest social media platform in China and we have accumulated about 800 participants in total in our co-learning activities.


## Co-learning Repos
> Some co-learning topics don't involve coding. In such cases, we use Notion to facilitate co-learning activities.

If you want to intiate a co-learning program, please feel free to reach out to us. It's our pleasure to assist you in making it a reality by promoting the program and providing you with the `Co-learning Protocol`. üëáüèª

## Co-learning Protocol
> An open-source facilitation framework of collective learning. Here we would like to thank [SoP](https://summerofprotocols.com/) and [GCC](https://www.gccofficial.org/) for providing grant in Apr.2024 for this protocol. üëê

Co-learning is the abbreviation of collective learning, also referred as group learning, or collaborative learning. It is a practice where participants collectively select topics, engage in learning and communication, take action, and reflect on the entire process.

It advocates for the non-individual nature of learning, implying the necessity for participants to engage in exchanges and discussions based on acquired information, and to learn from each other's life experiences during communications. Learning is not merely the intake of knowledge but also entails a positive interactive relationship with personal growth and societal change.

Currently, [@Shirlene](https://twitter.com/shirleneliu69) and [@Binhua](https://twitter.com/Binhua6) are working on the co-learning protocol, our intention is to open-source the co-learning model that we have established, so anyone in the world can reproduce this kind of co-learning activities given the manual that we developed. 

It will be published in the near future. Stay tuned! üöÄ
